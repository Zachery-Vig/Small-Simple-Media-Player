<h1>Small Simple Media Player</h1>

<h3>Small file size Media Player I made using wxwidgets and the miniaudio high level api that can scan a directory for song files and plays them like a playlist. Has features like song switching, volume control, progress slider, etc. To use just add your song files to a folder and give folder path to app on start.</h3>
  
<h3>Might add more features in the future like shuffle modes, more audio format options (currently only supports mp3 and wav), and metadata extraction.</h3>
<h3>miniaudio.h file was taken from miniaudio repo: https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio (use it its really neat)</h3>
