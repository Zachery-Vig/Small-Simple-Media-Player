# Small-Simple-Media-Player

Small file size Media Player I made using wxwidgets and the miniaudio high level api that can scan a directory for song files and plays them like a playlist with song switching, volume control, progress slider, etc. Might add more features in the future like shuffle modes, more audio format options (currently only supports mp3 and wav), and metadata extraction.
