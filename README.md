# Small-Simple-Media-Player

App I made using wxwidgets and miniaudio that can scan a directory for song files and plays them like a playlist with feutures like song switching, audio control, progress slider, different shuffle modes, etc. Currently supports audio formats miniaudio supports (mp3 and wav). The miniaudio.h file is taken from here: https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio.
